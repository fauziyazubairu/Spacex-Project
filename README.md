# IBM Data Science Capstone Project-SpaceX

This repo consist of all Jupiter labs files on the IBM Data Science Capstone project-SpaceX

In this capstone, i will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

Therefore if i can determine if the first stage will land, i can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

I will perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the data extracted from Spacex  where patterns in successful or unsuccessful launch sites will be discovered as well as anomalies. 

With graphical representation of launch site maps and Dashboards, assumptions can be checked and cleared.

Lastly, Machine Learning models like SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression will be executed using the test data in order to find the model that work best in predicting outcomes of future  launches.
